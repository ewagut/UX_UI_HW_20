        <p class="lead">Introduction</p>
        <p class="sectionLead">Overview</p>
        <p>An issue most of us face- food waste. Food waste in our homes makes up about 39% of all food waste in the US- about 42 billion pounds of food waste. This app will help users track of persihable items in their homes, helping them save money and reduce waste.</p>
        <p class="sectionLead">Role</p>
        <p>The project was a collaborative effort with 3 fellow UX/UI designers.</p>
        <p class="sectionLead">Timeline</p>

        <p>An app that helps you keep track of persihable in your home, helping you save money and reduce waste.</p>

            <p class="sectionLead">User Interviews</p>
            <p>We wanted to understand users experience with food waste in their home. We conducted 6 qualitative interviews and received 35 online survey reponses. We were particularly interested in how much and how often users throw away spoiled food and what level of interest users have in reducing food waste and their motivations to do so.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-lrg">
            <p>We found that almost all of our participants reported food waste in the last 2 weeks. Participants either keep a mental note of when their perishables are expiring or they do not track this at all. A majority of participants reported an interest in reducing food waste. </p>

                <img src="./images/empathymap.png" alt="EmpathyMap" style="height:430px;width:700px">
                <p>We created an affinity diagram and empathy map to organize our research findings. At this point in our design process we had a user persona in mind, Elizabeth Green. We wanted to help people like her, that cook at home, find a way to track when their food is expiring and when their food is about to spoil to avoid food and money waste.</p>

        <!--DEFINITION & IDEATION INCLUDES PROBLEM STATEMENT: COL SYSTEM-->

            <div class="col-lrg">
              <p class="lead">Phase 2: Definition & Ideation</p>
              <p class="sectionLead">Problem Statement</p>
              <p>A waste conscious home-cook who feels guilty about food waste needs to use all the food in their home before expiring but can’t keep track of the expirations dates.</p>
              <p class="sectionLead">Competitor Analysis</p>
              <p>We conducted a competitor analysis. We learned about what Elizabeth’s choices are today and found opportunities for competitor advantage. We wanted to highlight two direct competitors and one indirect competitor. NoWaste and Fridgely both help users track, organize and manage their food and focus on waste prevention which is what we are interested in doing, they are both popular apps with clean UI however they do not focus on providing information on how to prevent food waste. Our indirect competitor, Grocery, helps users create grocery lists, inventory and meal plans however that is the extent of it.</p>
              <p class="sectionLead">Feature Prioritization</p>
              <p>We created a feature prioritization matrix. Based off of the matrix we narrowed our key features down to 
              <p>1. Suggestions on what to do with food items that are about to expire or already expired (such as recipes or other ideas).</p>
              <p>2. Push or in-app notifications letting the user know that a food item is about to expire and already expired (including a calendar option for users who are more visual).</p>
              <p>3. A recipe page that can be organized based off of the user having the needed ingrediants.</p>
              <p>4. Add items to the inventory using a barcode or a grocery receipt to bulk upload.</p>
              <p>5. The ability to share inventory, shopping lists and recipes with household members.</p>
              <p class="lead">Phase 3: Prototyping</p>
              <p class="sectionLead">User Flow</p>
              <p>After defining the features of the app we created a user flow. After the user launches the app they can </p>
              <p>1. Add food items to their inventory and view the items in their inventory.</p>
              <p>2. View recipes based on their inventory and save recipes.</p>
              <p>3. Add a budget.</p>
              <p>4. Create a shopping list.</p>
              <p>5. Access their Waste Smart account.</p>

              <p class="lead">Phase 4: Testing & Iterating</p>
              <p class="sectionLead">Guerilla Testing</p>
              <p>We conducted usability tests with 5 participants, they were asked to complete 5 tasks using a prototype. Most of the participants were able to complete all tasks however they did have questions/confusion throghout the task completion. We took the findings from the test to iterate our prototype. There was confusion reagrding the navigation option "Budget" participants asked if it referred to budget for food or for waste. There was also confusion regarding the navigation option "Groceries" participants asked how to add to the grocery list.
                We iterated on these confusions.</p>

              <p class="sectionLead">Conclusion</p>
              <p>We identified a unique solution to the issue of food waste- alerting users when food is about to expire, offering ways to use the food item before it expires and suggesting recipes based on food inventory. However, WasteSmart is a work in progress! Future iterations may include one of the many features we included in our feature matrix and improving accessbility compliance.</p>
